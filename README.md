# BYB Project
This is just a simple GitHub project showcasing my ability in working with Git. 
## Description
There is very little going on in this project as it is just to show that I can work with Git and GitHub. Its aim is to complete one of the tasks of the HyperionDev boot camp.
## Installation
There is not much to the installation process. The project consists of a single .py file. There are no specific requirements to run the file as it only uses python built-in libraries.
You need to have Python installed on your machine to execute .py files.
## Usage
The included helloWorld.py file can be executed using the IDE of your choice or simply via command line.
## Credits
I would like to thank the team at HyperionDev for making this little project a reality :)
